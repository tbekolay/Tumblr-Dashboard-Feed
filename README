This script grabs the most recent 50 items in your Tumblr dashboard
and then creates an Atom feed that you can subscribe to in a feed reader.

This is designed to run on Google's App Egine.

Usage
-----

Copy sample.config.ini to config.ini and fill in your own values.

Once that's done, you can deploy this to AppEngine as usual. I prefer to keep
this code in a separate directly and make a symbolic link in the google_appengine
directory.
  cd /opt/google_appengine
  appcfg.py update your-app-name

TODO
----

See the full list on Github, but most important this should be using OAuth.

Credits
-------

Some of the initial ideas for the script came from PJ Kix's similar php script,
which can be found at https://github.com/pjkix/tumblr-dashboard-rss.

Changelog
---------

v0.2 (2012-01-12): Changed from a locally run script to run on Google App Engine.
  Now I can shut down my computer!
v0.1 (2011-09-13): Initial release. Feature complete, I think, but there are
  bound to be bugs.
