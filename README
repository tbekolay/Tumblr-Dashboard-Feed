This script grabs the most recent 50 items in your Tumblr dashboard
and then creates an Atom feed that you can subscribe to in a feed reader.

Requirements
------------

This script is designed for Python 2.6, but it may run on earlier and
later versions. If there are incompatiblities, please let me know at
tbekolay@gmail.com.

The following libraries are required:
 - ElementTree, should be included in Python, but locations change
 - feedformatter, which can be downloaded from
   http://code.google.com/p/feedformatter/ or easy_installed
   (easy_install feedformatter)

Usage
-----

To use the script, copy sample.config.ini to config.ini and fill in the
appropriate values. You can then run the script with
  python tumblr-dashboard-feed.py
which will output tumblr.xml (the raw data from Tumblr)
and atom.xml (an Atom feed that you can subscribe to).

Note that you will have to run this manually, and make atom.xml
accessible from the web if you subscribe in a feed reader like Google Reader.

I do this (and recommend you do this) by:
 - creating a cron task that runs the script once per minute
   (please not any more often, for the sake of Tumblr)
 - making a symbolic link to atom.xml in a directory that your web server
   knows about (for me, that's /var/www)

Credits
-------

Some of the initial ideas for the script came from PJ Kix's similar php script,
which can be found at https://github.com/pjkix/tumblr-dashboard-rss.

The script relies on the libraries listed above, so thanks to their respective
authors for creating them and making them freely available.

Changelog
---------

v0.1 (2011-09-13): Initial release. Feature complete, I think, but there are
  bound to be bugs.
